# Getting Your Mac Ready for Python Programming

Before we start our exciting journey into game programming, we need to set up the right tools on your computer. Think of this like getting your art supplies ready before painting a masterpiece!

We'll be installing two important programs:
1. **Python** - This is the programming language we'll use to create games
2. **PyCharm** - This is a special text editor designed specifically for writing Python code

Don't worry if this seems complicated at first - we'll go through each step carefully, and once it's set up, you won't need to do this again!

## Part 1: Installing Python

Python is the programming language we'll use throughout our lessons. Let's get it installed on your Mac.

### Step 1: Download Python

1. Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, or Firefox)
2. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. You'll see a big yellow button that says "Download Python 3.x.x" (the numbers might be different - that's okay!)

*[Screenshot placeholder: Python.org download page showing the yellow download button]*

4. Click on this yellow download button
5. A file will start downloading - it will be called something like "python-3.x.x-macosx10.9.pkg"
6. Wait for the download to finish (you'll see it in your Downloads folder or at the bottom of your browser)

If you see the Python version number, congratulations! Python is successfully installed.

## Part 2: Installing PyCharm

PyCharm is a powerful program that makes writing Python code much easier. It's like having a smart assistant that helps you write code!

### Step 1: Download PyCharm

1. Go to [jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
2. Make sure "macOS" is selected at the top
3. You'll see two versions: "Professional" and "Community"
4. Click "Download" under **Community** (it's free and perfect for learning!)

*[Screenshot placeholder: PyCharm download page showing Community edition]*

5. The download will start - it's a big file (about 500MB) so it might take a while
6. Wait for "pycharm-community-2023.x.x.dmg" to finish downloading

### Step 4: Configure Python in PyCharm

Now we need to tell PyCharm where to find the Python we just installed:

1. On the PyCharm welcome screen, click "New Project"

*[Screenshot placeholder: PyCharm welcome screen with New Project button]*

2. You'll see a "New Project" dialog
3. Make sure "Pure Python" is selected on the left
4. Choose a location for your project (the default is fine)
5. Expand the "Python Interpreter" section by clicking the arrow
6. Make sure "Add interpreter" is selected
7. Choose "System Interpreter" from the dropdown
8. Click the "..." button next to the interpreter path

*[Screenshot placeholder: New Project dialog with interpreter settings]*

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If something doesn't work, here are the most common fixes:

### Python Not Found
- Make sure you installed Python 3 (not Python 2)
- Try typing `python3 --version` in Terminal instead of `python --version`

### PyCharm Can't Find Python
- In PyCharm, go to "PyCharm" â†’ "Preferences" â†’ "Project" â†’ "Python Interpreter"
- Click the gear icon and "Add"
- Choose "System Interpreter" and browse to `/usr/bin/python3`

### Permission Errors
- Make sure you entered your Mac password when installing
- Try running Terminal as an administrator if needed
